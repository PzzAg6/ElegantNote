	abstract = {In many branch-and-price algorithms, the column generation pricing problem consists of computing feasible paths in a network. In this paper, we show how, in this context, path-reduced costs can be used to remove some arcs from the underlying network without compromising optimality, and we introduce a bidirectional search technique to compute these reduced costs. This arc elimination method can lead to a substantial speedup of the pricing process and the overall branch-and-price algorithm. Special attention is given to variants of shortest-path problems with resource constraints. Computational results obtained for the vehicle routing problem with time windows show the efficiency of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {We consider the multiple depot vehicle scheduling problem ({MDVSP}) and propose a branch-and-bound algorithm for solving it that combines column generation, variable fixing, and cutting planes. We show that the solutions of the linear relaxation of the {MDVSP} contain many “odd cycles.” We derive a class of valid inequalities by extending the notion of odd cycle and describe a lifting procedure for these inequalities. We prove that the lifted inequalities represent, under certain conditions, facets of the underlying polytope. Finally, we present the results of a computational study comparing several strategies (variable fixing, cutting planes, mixed branching, and tree search) for solving the {MDVSP}.},
